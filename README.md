# Next.js 15 Server-Side Props Fetch Failure in Production

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using `getServerSideProps` in Next.js 15 applications: data fetching failures in a production environment that work perfectly fine during local development.

## Problem

The `about.js` file attempts to fetch data from an external API using `node-fetch`. While this works seamlessly in development, the production build throws errors or returns unexpected results. This is often due to differences in the environment, such as network configurations, API access restrictions, or missing environment variables.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the production environment has proper network access, correct API keys, and robust error handling within the fetching logic.  Additional considerations include timeouts and retry mechanisms.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.
4. Observe that the About page fetches and displays data correctly.
5. Deploy the application to a production environment (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
6. Observe that the About page fails to fetch or displays incorrect data.
